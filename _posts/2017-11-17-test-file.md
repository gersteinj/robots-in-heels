Let's start with something easy - Markdown.

Markdown is at the core of a lot of the tools I use. It's simply a way of producing formatted files from plain text files. It's simple to work with - let me show you an example:

### Things I Use Markdown For

* My website - posts are written in Markdown and converted to HTML pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* Slide decks - depending what I'm doing, I use either [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) or [Reveal](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)
* Documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com)
* Notes to myself

### Reasons I like Markdown

1. Requires no special tools
2. Separates content from appearance
3. Source files are easy to read
4. Keeps my information from getting locked into a company's ecosystem

In Markdown, that looks like
```markdown
### Reasons I like Markdown

* Requires no special tools
* Separates content from appearance
* Source files are easy to read
```

A modern text editor will show the text above with the formatting you can see on this page. Many other tools will do the same. However, anything that can open a text file (pretty much any device) will be able to show you the original file. Because the formatting is designed to look like the output, it's still easy to read, even if it doesn't look as nice.

When processed, the markdown above produces the HTML below.

```html
<h3>Reasons I Like Markdown</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Requires no special tools</li>
  <li>Separates content from appearance</li>
  <li>Source files are easy to read</li>
</ul>
```

### How it works

1. Create a file with the .md extension - this is your *source file*
2. Write something in Markdown formatting and save your file
3. You're done. If you view the file somewhere compatible with Markdown, you'll see nicely formatted text. Otherwise, you'll see your original source file - which is still nicely organized text.
