I tend to use a lot of tools that don't get much attention in the education world, but at the request of a few teachers who were curious about my [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) slides from the [CTE and Maker Ed Panel at FabLearn](https://gersteinj.github.io/fablearn17/), I'm going to be posting about some of the tools I use. None of these tools are what we generally think of as edtech (and I'm not an edtech person), but they make my life easier and may do the same for you.

I tend to use a lot of open source tools, and the guides to using them are usually written for an audience with more experience and technical skill than most teachers will have. They're great tools, though, and not necessarily hard to use.

Some of the things I'll be covering:

* [Markdown](/2018/01/28/markdown) - A simple way to produce formatted documents from plain text files. Used for the core of a lot of other tools as well
* Reveal.js - Create slides from text files. Uses Markdown and/or HTML
* Git - Revision history for everything, not just documents created through MS Office or Google Apps
* Jekyll - Create webpages from Markdown files. Easy to manage through GitHub
